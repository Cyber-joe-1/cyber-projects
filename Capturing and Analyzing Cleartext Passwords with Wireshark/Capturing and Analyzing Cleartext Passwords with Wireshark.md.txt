In this project I captured an unencrypted HTTP password with Wireshark.

To get started I downloaded and installed Wireshark. After Wireshark was downloaded I opened it up and clicked my network adapter (Ethernet) and clicked on start capture.

Went to an insecure website to generate cleartext credentials.

The non HTTPS website I used is http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass.

The credentials I entered were Username: user, Password: pass

I clicked sign in which sends the credentials over HTTP.

Analyzed The Packets in Wireshark

Once in Wireshark I stopped the capture and in the filter bar I typed http contains "Authorization" (This filtered HTTP packets containing credentials).

Found the packet with an authorization header and clicked it and expanded it.

This is how credentials sent over HTTP can be visible in plaintext. Attackers can intercept logins on insecure websites. Always use HTTPS.
